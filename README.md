terminal_webapp
===============

Javascript for a makeshift terminal which is added to specified div in an html file.

Use of this is to easily include a custom terminal style interface to any website using a div and the javascript file provided. Whereas styling is easily done in css.

Minimal setup will be required, only customization, load method in html and id to div with the terminal.

Instructions for use will be included with the first usable version which is at least half way there.
